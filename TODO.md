## **Upcoming Improvements**

| **Task**                        | **Status** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Extend Stored Bucket Information** | ❇️         | Enrich the data stored in the GCS bucket (json files) to ensure seamless integration with the evaluator module and enable the creation of a comprehensive dashboard for data visualization and analysis. |
| **Enhance Multi-Language Handling** | 🚸         | 🪢 Implement a system to handle multiple languages more effectively, including a prompt and workflow that defaults to English. <br> 🪢 Introduce entry and exit levels for translating user queries from their native language to English, ensuring a seamless user experience. |
| **Knowledge Base Enhancement** |         | Transition the knowledge base from Italian documents to English documents to improve accessibility and user engagement for a wider audience. |
| **Optimize Workflow** |         | 🪢 *Improve LLM (Large Language Model) Responses*: Enhance the quality and accuracy of responses generated by the LLM. <br> 🪢 *Reduce Response Latency*: Investigate and implement caching mechanisms or store frequently accessed web crawling sites to minimize response times. Explore options such as parallelizing chunk retrieval to optimize efficiency. <br> 🪢 *Speed Up Element Loading*: Focus on reducing latency by implementing: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Asynchronous function caching (already implemented in the private repository). <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Optimization of document preprocessing functions (already implemented in the private repository). <br> 🪢 *YouTube Video Suggestions*: Review and refine the YouTube video suggestions to avoid recommending overly long videos, potentially requiring a shift in resource selection. <br> 🪢 *Code Refactoring*: Conduct an in-depth code refactor to improve maintainability and efficiency.
| **LLM Response Evaluation Module** |         | Develop an LLM response evaluation tool using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) buckets to assess the quality of generated responses. |
| **Data Visualization Dashboard** |         | Create a dashboard to visualize data post-processing, integrating it with the GCP bucket to provide intuitive and actionable insights. |
| **Update Presentation & README** |         | Revise the presentation material and update the README file to reflect the latest changes and improvements.                 |
| **Specialized Agent Testing** |         | Implement and test a separate branch featuring an agent specialized in a particular field (e.g., cardiology) to determine the benefits of focusing expertise on specific categories. |

## **Future Improvements**

| **Task**                        | **Status** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Specialized Medical Experts** |         | After the triage agent is implemented, deploy multiple specialized medical experts focused on specific areas to enhance the quality and relevance of responses. |
| **Guardrails for Inappropriate Queries and Anonimization** |         | Implement additional guardrails to prevent the system from processing or responding to inappropriate or harmful queries, ensuring a safe and secure user experience. |
| **Scalability and User Access** |         | Develop a solution to support a larger user base, possibly implementing user logins and paywall mechanisms to manage access and ensure scalability. |
| **Image Integration** |         | 🪢 Integrate image handling by: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Inserting images directly into the chat interface instead of text-based messages.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Enabling the extraction of images from PDFs for inclusion in responses. |
| **Chunk Context Parallelizations** |         | Parallelize the context creation function and improve the process for generating context chunks. This is primarily relevant during document processing and is performed infrequently. |
| **Migration to Ollama** |         | Explore migrating to Ollama to alleviate potential API rate limitations imposed by Groq, enhancing system stability and performance. |
